# Billing/Contract System
## Config file

There is also some config files in `s1n_billing/configuration/server/`

For both QBCore and ESX :

```lua
Config = Config or {}

-- The Framework (QB/ESX) is detected automatically with our script s1n_lib (If an error occurs, you can set the framework name manually in the configuration file of s1n_lib)

-- To modify the language, go to the fxmanifest.lua file and replace 'languages/english.lua' with the language you want (like 'languages/french.lua')

-- Set to true to show debug messages in the console or false to hide them
Config.DebugMode = true
