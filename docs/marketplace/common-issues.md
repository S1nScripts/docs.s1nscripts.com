### Issues

#### The vehicle product is called 'NULL', 'CARNOTFOUND' or isn't written properly on the marketplace

Your imported car is missing the call to the FiveM Native AddTextEntry to add a name to it.

If you bought it from a store, you need to ask them to add it.
Otherwise you need to create a script specifically to name your imported vehicles.
