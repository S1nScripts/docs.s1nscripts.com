# Banking System
## Installation

Follow these steps to install the banking system:


1. Drag the `s1n_banking` folder into your `resources` directory. (you might need to rename the script's folder)
3. Start the banking system by adding `start s1n_banking` to your `server.cfg` file.
4. Please insert the SQL queries in your database (you can find them in the `s1n_banking/database.sql` file).
5. Configure the script by modifying the values in the `config.lua` file located in the `s1n_banking/shared/` script folder.
