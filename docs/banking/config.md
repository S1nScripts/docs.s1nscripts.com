# Banking System
## Config file

There is also a config file in `s1n_banking/server/config.lua` that you can modify to your liking.

For both QBCore and ESX :

```lua
Config = Config or { }

-- Set to true to show debug messages in the console
Config.debugMode = true

Config.Framework = {
    FrameworkName  = 'QBCore', -- Choose your framework: ESX or QBCore
    QBCoreFileName = 'qb-core', -- The name of the QBCore resource
    OldESX         = false, -- Set to true if you're using an older version of ESX which still uses the ESX event esx:getSharedObject
    ESXEvent       = 'esx:getSharedObject', -- The name of the ESX event
    ESXFileName    = 'es_extended', -- The name of the ESX resource
    SQLWrapper     = 'oxmysql' --  oxmysql (HIGHLY RECOMMANDED) / mysql-async (deprecated) / ghmattimysql (deprecated)
