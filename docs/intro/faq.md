# FAQ

### What frameworks are your scripts compatible with?
Our scripts are currently compatible with ESX and QbCore. However, it is fairly simple to configure the script for another framework, as our scripts are standalone. If you want us to support another framework, please suggest it on our Discord server.

### Do you provide support for your scripts?
Yes, we provide support on our Discord server.

### What should I do if my script has an error?
If we do not address your error in our documentation, please open a support ticket on our Discord server and provide your Tebex invoice ID.
