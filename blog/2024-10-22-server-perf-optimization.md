# FiveM Server Performance Optimization: Best Practices & Tips

Running a smooth FiveM server requires careful optimization and regular maintenance. This comprehensive guide will walk you through proven techniques to enhance your server's performance and reduce lag.

## Understanding Server Performance Metrics

Before diving into optimization, it's crucial to understand key performance indicators:

- **Server tick rate**: Ideal range is 48-60ms
- **CPU usage**: Should stay below 80%
- **Memory consumption**: Monitor for memory leaks
- **Network latency**: Target < 100ms for optimal gameplay

## Essential Server Configuration Tweaks

### Basic server.cfg Optimization

```lua
# Performance-related settings
set onesync on
set onesync_population false
set sv_enforceGameBuild 2944
set sv_clockSync true
set sv_scriptHookAllowed 0

# Connection settings
sv_maxClients 48
set sv_endpointPrivacy true

# Network optimization
sv_scriptHookAllowed 0
set sv_forceIndirectListing true
```

### OneSync Configuration

OneSync is crucial for server performance. Here's how to optimize it:

1. Enable OneSync Legacy
2. Configure entity culling
3. Set proper population density
4. Adjust streaming range

## Resource Management

### Script Loading Order

Optimize your resource loading sequence:

1. Core framework resources
2. Database connections
3. Essential game mechanics
4. Optional features
5. Non-essential scripts

### Resource Monitoring

```lua
# Add to server.cfg
set game_enableTaskScheduler true
set game_enableOptimizedScheduler true
```

## Database Optimization

### MySQL Performance Tips

1. Implement connection pooling
2. Use proper indexing
3. Regular database maintenance
4. Query optimization

```sql
-- Example of an optimized query
SELECT * FROM players 
WHERE last_seen > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
INDEX(last_seen);
```

## Common Performance Issues and Solutions

### Script-Related Problems

1. **Memory Leaks**
   - Monitor resource memory usage
   - Implement garbage collection
   - Regular server restarts

2. **CPU Bottlenecks**
   - Identify heavy scripts
   - Implement async operations
   - Optimize loops and functions

### Network Optimization

```lua
-- Network configuration
setr voice_useNativeAudio true
setr voice_useSendingRangeOnly true
set sv_maxConcurrentResources 100
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Entity Management

1. **Entity Culling**
   ```lua
   -- Add to your resource manifest
   lua54 'yes'
   game 'gta5'
   fx_version 'cerulean'
   ```

2. **Stream Distance**
   ```lua
   -- Optimized streaming distance
   SetStreamDistance(500.0)
   ```

### Performance Monitoring Tools

1. **Server Monitoring**
   - txAdmin dashboard
   - Resource monitor
   - Network statistics

2. **Diagnostic Tools**
   - FiveM debug console
   - Performance profiler
   - Memory snapshots

## Best Practices for Long-Term Performance

1. Regular maintenance schedule
2. Backup system implementation
3. Update management strategy
4. Resource audit process

## Performance Testing

### Stress Testing Protocol

1. Simulate player load
2. Monitor resource usage
3. Check for memory leaks
4. Verify network stability

## Optimization Checklist

✓ Server configuration review  
✓ Resource audit  
✓ Database optimization  
✓ Network settings  
✓ Entity management  
✓ Monitoring tools setup  

## Conclusion

Optimizing your FiveM server is an ongoing process that requires regular attention and maintenance. By following these best practices and implementing the suggested optimizations, you can significantly improve your server's performance and player experience.
